# RLD

### Reinforcement Learning course from Master M2A (DAC) @ Sorbonne Universit√© Paris.
Course website: https://dac.lip6.fr/master/rld-2021-2022/

### Getting started:
main.py contains an hyperparameters search tool. A main file for each algorithm/TME is available under 'TP' folder.
Hyperparameters of each algorithm can be tuned in 'Config/model_parameters', and then executed through the associated main function in 'TP'.

### Implemented Algorithms:
- UCB and LinUCB Bandits
- Policy and Value Iteration 
- QLearning, SARSA, DynaQ
- Deep Q Learning (minDQN), DuelingDQN
- Actor Critic A2C
- Trusted Region Actor Critic PPO and Clipped PPO
- DDPG, Multi Agent DDPG
- SAC, Adaptative Temperature SAC
- Imitation Learning (GAIL)
- GAN, VAE

### Environnement:
Grid World, Cartpole, Lunar Lander, Pendulum
